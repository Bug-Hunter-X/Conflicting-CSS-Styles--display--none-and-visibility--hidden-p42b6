This repository demonstrates an uncommon HTML bug involving conflicting CSS styles.  The bug occurs when both `display: none` and `visibility: hidden` are applied to the same element. Although intended to hide an element, this combination can cause unexpected issues and make it seemingly impossible to show the element again using Javascript or other means. The solution provided demonstrates the correct approach to hiding and showing HTML elements.
